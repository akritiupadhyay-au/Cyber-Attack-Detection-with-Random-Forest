# Cyber Attack Detection with Random Forest

## Detecting Cyber Attacks using machine learning
To improve cyber security, machine learning algorithms can be implemented to detect cyber attacks.

The approach involves analyzing network data to identify potential attacks by identifying correlations between various variables.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the accuracy and efficiency of cyber attack detection can be improved. It will enhance the security of digital networks and systems.

## Cyber attack data

The data is collected by the University of New South Wales (Australia). That includes records of different types of cyber attacks. The dataset contains network packets captured in the Cyber Range Lab of UNSW Canberra. The data is provided in two sets of training and testing data.

The dataset includes nine types of attacks, including:

1. Fuzzers: Attack that involves sending random data to a system to test its resilience and identify any vulnerabilities.

2. Analysis: A type of attack that involves analyzing the system to identify its weaknesses and potential targets for exploitation.

3. Backdoors: Attack that involves creating a hidden entry point into a system for later use by the attacker.

4. DoS (Denial of Service): Attack that aims to disrupt the normal functioning of a system, making it unavailable to its users.

5. Exploits: Attack that leverages a vulnerability in a system to gain unauthorized access or control.

6. Generic: A catch-all category that includes a variety of different attack types that do not fit into the other categories.

7. Reconnaissance: Attack that involves gathering information about a target system, such as its vulnerabilities and potential entry points, in preparation for a future attack.
   
8. Shellcode: Attack that involves executing malicious code, typically in the form of shell scripts, on a target system.

9. Worms: A type of malware that spreads itself automatically to other systems, often causing harm in the process.

These nine categories cover a wide range of attack types that can be used to exploit a system, and it is important to be aware of them to protect against potential security threats.
